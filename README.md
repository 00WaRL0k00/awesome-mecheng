### Mechanical Engineering & Related PE License for USA
A PE license is probably the most useful certification that a mechanical engineer can obtain.  A PE license is only actually a requirement if you want to provide services directly to the public, but it is still a good thing to have regardless.  It is a sign to employers and clients that you are a competent engineer, and the act of studying for the exam will sharpen your skills. This examination is organized by [NCEES - National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying](http://ncees.org/).

### GATE for India
[GATE Official Website](www.gate.iitr.ernet.in/)

GATE or [Graduate Aptitute Test in Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Aptitude_Test_in_Engineering) is a qualifying examination conducted by a consortium of [Indian Institutes of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology) and [Indian Institute of Science Bangalore](http://www.iisc.ac.in/). Even though the official reason to conduct GATE is for post-graduate admissions only, PSUs and Govt. research entities often recruit students on the basis of GATE score.
